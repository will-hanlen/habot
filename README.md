# Habot
A Discord bot for tracking habits

---

Accountability is a key component of habit building.

Accountability in digital communities is hard to do because personal accountability is hard to scale.

My solution is to build a Discord bot through which members can set goals and publicly log progress.

## Try it out

Go to the `#habits` channel of the [LIVEINEVERYNOW Discord server](https://discord.gg/KG7AHxsY2y) to try the bot out.

Just enter in the habit you want to build, then log you progress in a channel with all your internet buddies encouraging you and keeping you accountable.
